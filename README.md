# GestureRecognition
GestureRecognition using deep learning techniques

**Problem Statement**

Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

Thumbs up:  Increase the volume

Thumbs down: Decrease the volume

Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds

Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds

Stop: Pause the movie
